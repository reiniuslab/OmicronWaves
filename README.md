## Abstract
Throughout the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, multiple waves of variants of concern have swept 
across populations, leading to a chain of new and yet more contagious lineages dominating 
COVID-19 cases. Here, we tracked the remarkably rapid shift from Omicron BA.1 to BA.2 sub-variant 
dominance in the Swedish population. By analysis of 174,933 clinical nasopharyngeal 
swab samples using a custom variant-typing RT-PCR assay, we uncover nearly two-fold higher 
levels of viral RNA in cases with Omicron BA.2. Importantly, increased viral load in the upper 
pharynx upon BA.2 infection may provide one piece of the explanation why Omicron BA.2 is 
more contagious and currently outcompetes the BA.1 variant across populations.
